# FIT 2014_04_24 Interactive Fabrication
## replicavaton of information objects
* using words
    * synchronous
    * co-located
* writing
    * asynchronous
    * distributed
* slow reproduction changed with Gutenberg

### advantages of analog to digital?
* share remotely, quickly
* store massive information in small space
* search faster

### difference between analog and digital
* share & duplicate
* lossless
    * touch the data as often as you want
        * do crazy computation on it
    * many people can do many things with it

## replication of physical objects
* with physical objects we are at the stage of Gutenberg
    * centralized fabrication with large machinery
        * negative forms produce high numbers of units very cheap
    * great for standardized objects
    * bad for customized objects

## personal fabrication
* low setup costs, individual object more expensive

### 3D printer
* additive, no negative form
* 3d model out of plastic
* no setup costs, but then more expensive
* mainly layers of plastic
    * others work with powder or laser
    * many different materials (wood-like, chocolate)
* takes long

### laser cutter
* cut 2d shapes from wood, acrylic or paper
* different modes
* very precise, can create working gears

### milling machines
* substractive fabrication

* these devices take digital models and fabricate them

### ways to create digital models
* 3d scanner: collects shape and appearance of object
    * e.g. Kinect Fusion
* 3d modeling: requires training, time
* share models on thingiverse 

### personal fab:: sharing
* have the same benefits discussed with information
    * huge choice
    * everyone can produce, share,  express themselves
    * distributed distribution
    * infinite replication


## fast prototyping & design iteration
*  3d printers are very slow
*  laser cutters can only do 2D

### LaserOrigami
* also folds
* iterate over different designs in minutes
* if you move workpiece further away from laser, it is defocused
    * this is bending mode
* limited to Origami shapes

### Only 3D print whats necessary
* build the rest with Lego -> fabrickator
* another idea: use laser cutted parts where possible
* WirePrint: To just prototype shape, only print wireframes
    * Not only printing layer-wise but also vertically
    * inspired by 3Doodler
* That was all pre-fabrication
* idea: print on existing material


## interactive objects
* 3d printers so far only print passive objects
* PrintedOptics: print glass-fibers inside
    * Sensors printed with the same technique
    * Light Sensors
* Soft objects?
    *  Knitting
*  Interactive speakers
    * Conductive paint 
* more and more things become possible, but still difficult for average user

## digital editing for the novice user
* isometric hand drawings -> 3d model
    * automatic generation of laser cuttable parts
* sketch chair with ergonomic test
* codable objects


## physical editing
* mixed-reality: physical tools + virtual objects
* dressup: create dresses around physical mannequin
* is this a good interface?

## interactive fabrication
* directly annotate objects
    * slow but closes the loop
* foam printer
* tradition craft: user bottleneck; interactive fab: machine bottleneck
* constructable: interactive laser cutting

### advantages and disadvantages of interactive fabrication?
* wysiwyg, test objects incrementally
* no undo, precision, zooming
* remote interaction?

## fab around a virtual model
* existing 3D model as a base to interact from there
* e.g. force feeback arm + glue gun
* e.g. position correcting router
* sculpting by numbers: displays red and green where you need to add or remove material
* drawing guidance: magnetic actuation: only hold pen
* scissors that prevent you from mistakes
    * conductive ink
    * when scissor hits it cursor is closed

## replication and the value of objects
* more things might not always be better (e.g. art, gifts)
* relocating objects over distance: scotty
* milling layerwise and refabricating on the other side
* top layer becomes botton layer 

### games with real-world consequences
* no restart
* destroying â‚¬ bills
