## Science
* Science works by falsifiying statements
* If a study disagrees, you know that a law does not hold
* If a study agrees, you keep this as a woring hypothesis
* ... which means you are never positive!
* If we observe something, it supports a claim. not proove it.

## Hick's Law
* Could be true or false

## Mince Evers Video
* Vermutung: Im Kühlschrank ist noch Bier.
* In der Theologie werden Vermutungen nicht überprüft.
* Ein Theologe kann in 5 Minuten mehr behaupten als ein Wissenschaftler in seinem ganzen Leben wiederlegen kann
* In der Wissenschaft bleibt immer ein Restzweifel

## Why would you run studies in HCI?
* Studies in HCI can validate designs
* Sound of science is not "Heureka" but "That's odd"
* Death Ray: "mad scientist" are just mad engineers

## understanding touch
* what is the underlying assumption of all touch sensors?
	* contact area and center of the contact area?
	* assumption: the contact area is what your trying to indicate to
* touc input is inacurate
* new model: people are aiming with the center of ther fingernail
* people have now idea about the contact area
* The new model fits 10 times better
* touch sensor based on the old model can't be acurate
* new model will be a better model
* majority: engineer something, make measurements

## experiments
* experiments are questions to nature
* nature responds with data
* statistics are the tools to interpret the response

## what can go when processing study results?
* scientific dishonesty: mostly non-publishing of unfavored results

## human reaction time
* stay on same level, high at beginning, fluctuating?

## outliers
* how do you justify removing outliers
* created by other external factors
* it seems less likely that it just took the person long

## learning period
* remove it? it depends!
* if the study is about learning, keep it. elsehow, not.

## histogram
* see distribution better
* but you loose exact timing
* first look at a raw bar chart and then start aggregating

## what would histogram of human reaction time look like?
* infinite or finite to the left or right?
* right infinite, no upper bound
* not symmetric because bound on one side and no bound on other
* depending on how much repetitions you have irregularities can happen
 
## debugging results
* trad snapping anectode
	* programming bug led to unusual results

## summary
* look at raw data first
* learning or fatigue
* bugs in your apparatus
* side effect: by spending more time with your data you might notice something that can lead to your next idea
